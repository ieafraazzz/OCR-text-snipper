# ✂ OCR Text Snipper

A lightweight screen-region OCR tool that lives in your system tray. Draw a box around any text on your screen — it's instantly extracted and copied to your clipboard.

## Features

- **System tray app** — runs quietly in the background, always one shortcut away
- **Global hotkey** — `Ctrl+Shift+S` triggers snip mode from anywhere (Windows)
- **Punch-out overlay** — selected region stays bright while the rest dims, just like the Windows Snipping Tool
- **Result popup** — floating card shows the extracted text; edit it before copying, or dismiss it
- **Auto-dismiss** — the popup closes itself after 10 seconds if left alone
- **Snip history** — last 20 snips are stored locally and accessible from the tray menu
- **HiDPI support** — device-pixel-ratio aware for crisp captures on Retina / 4K displays
- **Auto-upscaling** — small regions are automatically upscaled before OCR for better accuracy
- **Auto-detects Tesseract** — no hardcoded paths; searches common install locations automatically

## How it works

```
Hotkey / tray click
        │
        ▼
 Capture full screen (mss)
        │
        ▼
 Show punch-out overlay (PyQt5)
        │
   User draws region
        │
        ▼
 Crop → upscale if tiny → Tesseract OCR (pytesseract)
        │
        ▼
 Copy to clipboard (pyperclip) + save to history
        │
        ▼
 Show floating result card (editable)

## Tips for better results

- **Too much noise?** Zoom in before snipping, or snip a tighter region around just the text.
- **Non-Latin languages?** Pass a language code: change `--psm 6` to `--psm 6 -l jpn` (etc.) and install the relevant Tesseract language pack.
- **Very small text?** The auto-upscaler kicks in for regions under 300px, but scaling your display before snipping also helps.
